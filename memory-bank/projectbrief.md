# Project Brief: 3D AI Scene Editor

## Project Overview
The 3D AI Scene Editor is a browser-based application that enables users to create, manipulate, and render 3D scenes with AI-assisted generation capabilities. It combines a powerful 3D engine with intuitive UI controls and AI content generation to create a seamless creative experience.

## Core Requirements

1. **3D Scene Editing**: Real-time creation and manipulation of 3D entities within a browser environment
2. **AI Integration**: Leverage AI for content generation, including 3D models, textures, image renders and video generation
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI that makes 3D creation accessible
4. **High-Quality Rendering**: Capability to render scenes for export and further AI processing

## Technical Goals

- Decoupled architecture separating 3D engine from React UI
- Type-safe event communication system
- Comprehensive entity management with history support
- Streamlined rendering pipeline for screenshots and AI operations

## Target Users

- 3D artists looking for AI-assisted creation tools
- Digital content creators who need 3D assets
- Designers who want to quickly prototype 3D scenes
- Non-technical users who want to create 3D content without specialized knowledge

## Success Criteria

- Users can create complex 3D scenes without 3D modeling experience
- AI assistance meaningfully enhances the creative process
- The application remains performant even with complex scenes
- High-quality renders suitable for production use or further AI processing
