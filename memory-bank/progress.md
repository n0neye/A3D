# Progress: 3D AI Scene Editor

## Current Status

The project is in development with initial documentation established through the Memory Bank. Based on README.md, the application has a defined architecture and core functionality implementation. The project utilizes Three.js for 3D rendering, having migrated from Babylon.js.

## What Works

From the README.md, the following functionality appears to be implemented:

1. **Core Engine**:
   - Three.js integration and rendering
   - Entity creation and management
   - Camera controls and navigation
   - Selection and transformation controls
   - History management (undo/redo)

2. **UI Components**:
   - Base editor UI container
   - Frame panel for viewport control
   - Render panel for screenshots
   - Entity panel for object management

3. **Input Handling**:
   - Keyboard shortcuts (W, E, R, T for transform modes)
   - Selection via clicking
   - Delete key for removing entities
   - Ctrl+D for duplication
   - Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Z for undo/redo

4. **Rendering Capabilities**:
   - Taking screenshots
   - Processing depth maps
   - Managing gizmo visibility during renders
   - Image processing for API operations

## What's Left to Build/Improve

Without examining the full codebase, these are educated guesses based on README.md:

1. **AI Integration**:
   - Enhanced AI generation capabilities
   - More sophisticated AI scene manipulation
   - Optimization of AI service usage
   - Generation and render history tracking via IGenerationLog and IRenderLog

2. **User Experience**:
   - Improved onboarding for new users
   - More intuitive controls and feedback
   - Enhanced visualization options

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Scene complexity management
   - Asset loading improvements
   - Render pipeline optimization

4. **Collaboration Features**:
   - Real-time collaborative editing
   - Sharing and publishing workflows
   - Version control for scenes

## Known Issues

Without specific issue reports in README.md, typical challenges in this domain include:

1. **Performance Bottlenecks**:
   - Complex scenes may cause performance degradation
   - Mobile performance may be limited

2. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - WebGL capabilities vary across browsers
   - Potential issues with older browsers

3. **AI Service Limitations**:
   - Rate limits for API calls
   - Latency in generation responses
   - Cost management for API usage

## Next Development Milestones

To be determined after further exploration of the codebase and current development priorities. Initial suggestions based on README.md:

1. **Enhanced Entity Management**:
   - More sophisticated entity types
   - Advanced properties and behaviors
   - Grouping and organization features

2. **Expanded Rendering Options**:
   - Additional render styles and effects
   - Export format options
   - Batch rendering capabilities

3. **AI Feature Expansion**:
   - More generation options
   - Scene-wide AI enhancements
   - Style transfer capabilities
